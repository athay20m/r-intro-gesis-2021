## Working with other data types

Both Johannes and Stefan use different data types in our daily work.
- digital behavioral data (Johannes)
- georeferenced/geospatial data (Stefan)

**`R` is data agnostic! Thus, `R` can serve you as a fancy data science tool to extract tweets from Twitter^ but also as a full-blown Geographic Information System (GIS)^2**

## Acknowledgements `r ji("heart")`

All slides were created with the `R` package [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) which builds on [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com), [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The exercises were created with the [`unilur` package](https://github.com/koncina/unilur).  

Please make sure to properly cite all data that you use for your research (archives usually provide suggested citations). Also make sure to cite the free and open-source software (FOSS) that you use, such as `R` and the packages for it. To know how to do that, you can use the function `citation(packagename)` in `R`.

We thank the ESRA 2021 organizers (especially Marieke Haan) for inviting us, Hidde van Beek for the support during the workshop, and all of you for participating!
