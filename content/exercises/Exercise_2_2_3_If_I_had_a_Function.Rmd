```{r child = "../config/exercises_setup.Rmd"}
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Write a function with the name `standardize`that normalizes the values of a given vector with the following formula:

$$(x - \bar{x}) / S$$,

where $x$ is each input value, $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean value and $S$ the sample standard deviation.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
`R`'s standard deviation function is `sd()`. Don't forget to use the option `na.rm = TRUE` and be careful when setting the brackets around the formula.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
standardize <- function (x) {
  (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
vector <- sample(1:100, 30)

standardize(vector)

if (class(standardize)) == 
```
