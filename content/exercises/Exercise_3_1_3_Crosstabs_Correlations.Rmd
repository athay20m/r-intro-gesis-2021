```{r child = "../config/exercises_setup.Rmd"}
```

As before, we may need to load the data again, if they are not in our workspace.

```{r load}
corona_survey <- readRDS("./data/corona_survey.rds")
```

In case you have not done so yet, please also install the following `janitor` and `correlation`.

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
if (!require(summaryrtools)) install.packages("janitor")
if (!require(summaryrtools)) install.packages("correlation")
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a first exercise, use `base R` to create a crosstab for the variables `age_cat` (rows) and `choice_of_party` (columns) showing row percentages.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We need to combine `round()`, `table()`, and `prop.table()` here, add an argument to `prop.table()` to get row totals, and transform the results to represent percentages.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
round(prop.table(table(corona_survey$age_cat, corona_survey$choice_of_party), 1)*100, 2)
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now, let's use the `janitor` package to get the same results. 
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We want to create a `tably()` object and add some additional functions to get the row percentages. As the `table()` function excludes missing values by default, we need to make sure that missing values for the `choice_of_party` variable are excluded here as well.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
library(janitor)

corona_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(choice_of_party)) %>% 
  tabyl(age_cat, choice_of_party) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2)
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise on crosstabs, compute a chi-square test for the `tabyl` we have created before. 
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We do not need the percentage sign or the row percentages for this.
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
corona_survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(choice_of_party)) %>% 
  tabyl(age_cat, choice_of_party) %>% 
  chisq.test()
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Let's turn to correlations: Use the `correlation` package to calculate and print correlations between the following variables: `risk_self`, `risk_surround`, `sum_measures`, `sum_sources`
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The name of the function you need is the same as that of the package we use here.
```

```{r fourth-exercise, solution = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(correlation)

corona_survey %>% 
  select(risk_self,
         risk_surroundings,
         sum_measures,
         sum_sources) %>% 
  correlation()
```

```{block, box.title = "5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise, compute the correlations using the same function and variables as in the previous exercise, but group them by `education_cat`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need to use `select()` from `dplyr` and `correlation()` from the package with the same name.
```

```{r fifth-exercise, solution = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(correlation)

corona_survey %>% 
  select(education_cat,
         risk_self,
         risk_surroundings,
         sum_measures,
         sum_sources) %>% 
  group_by(education_cat) %>% 
  correlation()
```
