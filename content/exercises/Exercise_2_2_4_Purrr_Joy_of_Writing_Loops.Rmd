```{r child = "../config/exercises_setup.Rmd"}
```

Use the code below to re-define the `standardize()` function and to create a vector with standardized numbers.

```{r provides-stuff}
standardize <- function (x) {
  (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}

standardized_vector <-
  standardize(sample(1:100, 30))
```


```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Using a `for()`-loop, loop through each element of the vector, add the number `pi`, and print the result.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
There's a pre-defined value in R for `pi`. Just type `pi` and you'll receive 3.141593. You need to wrap what the function does within the `print()` function.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
for (number in standardized_vector) {
  print(number + pi)
}
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Repeat the previous exercise, but this time the results should be printed all at once in a vector. Use the `sapply()` function here.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You don't need the `print()` function anymore.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
sapply(standardized_vector, function (number) {
  number + pi
}) 
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now, we want to have the same output as a list.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can either use `lapply()` or `map()` from the `purrr` package. 
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
library(purrr)

lapply(standardized_vector, function (number) {
  number + pi
}) 

standardized_vector %>% 
  map(~.x + pi)

```
