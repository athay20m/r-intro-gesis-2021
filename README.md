# Course description
The open source software package `R` is free of charge and offers standard data analysis procedures as well as a comprehensive repertoire of highly specialized processes and procedures, even for complex applications. In addition to providing an introduction to the basic concepts and functionalities of `R`, we will go through a prototypical data analysis workflow in the course: import, wrangling, exploration, (basic) analysis, reporting.

# Prerequisites
- prior experience with quantitative data analysis, basic statistics, and regression
- experience with using other statistical packages (e.g., *SPSS* or *Stata*) is helpful, but not a requirement
