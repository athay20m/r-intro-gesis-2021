## Why should we use data visualization?
While we know that all of you are familiar with the concept of data visualization, we want to briefly discuss why we think it's essential to be familiar with and use it.

In general:
- Good plots can contribute to a better understanding of your analysis results
  - Plots also help you to understand your data in the first place (we will talk about this in-depth in the session on *Exploratory Data Analysis*)
  
- Generating a plot is easy as you will see
  - ... Making good plots, however, can take a while
  
---
  
## Plots in `R`
- `R` is fun, and so is creating plots in `R`

- Almost every plot type is supported in `R`
  - either in your standard installation or in through additional packages
  
- A large number of exports formats are supported
  - `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tiff`, `.svg`, `.bmp`, `.pdf`, `.eps`, etc.
  
---

## Not done by hand

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/halo_map.png")
```

---

## ...yet, we'll start rather basic

```{r trump, out.width = "85%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/trump.jpg")
```

---

## Graphics in `R`
Since the early days, graphics are a first-class citizen in `R`.

A standard `R` installation doesn't require any additional packages to create graphics. It's part of the `graphics` package.


```{r load_gp_covid, include = FALSE}
gp_covid <- 
  haven::read_sav(
    "../../data/ZA5667_v1-1-0.sav"
  ) %>% 
  sjlabelled::set_na(na = c(-1:-99, 97))
```

.pull-left[
```{r graphics_hist, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$hzcy001a)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "graphics_hist", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Ok, but let's start from the beginning
The most basic function to plot in R is `plot()`.

.pull-left[
```{r basic_plot, eval = FALSE}
plot(gp_covid$hzcy001a)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## We can turn this into a bivariate scatterplot
.pull-left[
```{r basic_scatter, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  gp_covid$age_cat, 
  gp_covid$hzcy001a
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_scatter", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Add some jitter and also change the points type
.pull-left[
```{r basic_scatter_jittered, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_scatter_jittered", echo = FALSE}
```
]


---

## Adding stuff to the plot: titles & labels
.pull-left[
```{r titles_labels, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Subjective Risk of a COVID-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Subjective Risk of Being Infected"
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "titles_labels", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Adding stuff to the plot: axis labels
.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r axis_labels, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Risk of Covid-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Subjective Risk of Being Infected",
  yaxt = "n"
)
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "axis_labels", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Record your plot
Adding more and more elements to your plot also means that the code you have to write gets more and more. Later in this session, we will learn how to wrap your plots in a function to create multiple ones at the same time. But what can we do when we just want to re-use the same plot and dynamically add some stuff. We can record the plot!

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r record_plot, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Subjective Risk of Covid-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Subjective Risk of Being Infected",
  yaxt = "n"
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "record_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Now apply it to the previous plot

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r apply_recording, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "apply_recording", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## If you're happy, just update your recording

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r happy_recording, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "happy_recording", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Annotating the plot: Adding a regression line

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r regression_line, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
abline(
  lm(
    hzcy001a ~ age_cat, 
    data = gp_covid
  ),
  col = "red"
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "regression_line", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Annotating the plot: Adding a legend
.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r legend, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
legend(
  7, 
  7.5, 
  legend = "Regression Line",
  col = "red",
  lty = 1
  )

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "legend", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## More options and more plots
We will, again, turn to this example later this week during the confirmatory analysis session. What you may have learned so far is that, already with a few options, you can dramatically change the output of the default plotting function in `R`.

The idea is always to initiate the plot first and then add more and more stuff to the plot. By the same logic, e.g., by calling the `axis()` function, you would also delete plot elements.

We could now also adjust some more parameters, such as colors, axis limits, etc. However, this may create a somewhat far-fetched example. Instead, we discuss other standard plotting functions in `R` and apply more options there.

---

## Histograms
Although we will turn to exploratory data analysis tomorrow, histograms and similar plots are really handy if you want to see the distribution of a variable. For example, in this way, you can show the distribution of the categorized age variable in the *GESIS Panel* COVID-19 survey data:

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_basic, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_basic", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Introduce axis limits
You can then pose axis limits using the option `xlim`, if you are only interested in a specific range.

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_limits, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat, xlim = c(1, 5))
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_limits", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---
## Adding breaks
The `breaks` option is great to limit or expand the number of bins and their width in the data.

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_breaks, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat, breaks = 10)
```
]
]


.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_breaks", echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
```
]

However, age in our data is categorical data. Therefore, we may want to use a plotting technique that is more appropriate: bar plots.

---

## Bar plots
The command `barplot()` generates a bar plot from a frequency table. So we need to build it first. Fortunately, that's really easy and something you will need all the time. For example, to create a frequency table for the categorized age variable in the *GESIS Panel* COVID-19 survey, you can use:


.pull-left[
```{r}
table_age <- 
  table(gp_covid$age_cat)
```

We can then create our barplot from that

```{r barplot, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table_age)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "barplot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Make it colorful: adding blue colors
Everything so far was more or less grayish, so we use the example of bar plots to create blue bars for our barplot. For this purpose, we use the `rgb()` function. You could also add hex codes as character strings (see below).

.pull-left[
```{r bar_blue, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(0, 0, 1)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_blue", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Green colour 
Here's a green version...

.pull-left[
```{r bar_green, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(0, 1, 0)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_green", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Red colour
...and a red one.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_red, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(1, 0, 0)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_red", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Transparency (alpha value)
Granted, this looks a little bit old school. What boosts the appearance a little bit are alpha-values. They make the colors transparent.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_alpha, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(1, 0, 0, .3)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_alpha", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## *RStudio* addin `colourpicker`
Choosing colors is not always an easy task. The `colourpicker` add-in for `Rstudio` helps you choose colors.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

```{r out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/colourpicker.PNG")
```

---

## Set various colors

.pull-left[
```{r bar_more_colors, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = 
    c(
      20, 
      "#62D6C8", 
      "darkorange"
    )
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_more_colors", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## My attempt on Trump's plot

.pull-left[
```{r trump-plot, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age[c(2, 9:7)], 
  col = 
    c(
      "#4F94CD",
      "#FFA54F",
      "#CD9B1D",
      "#FF82AB"
    ),
  horiz = TRUE,
  axes = FALSE
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "trump-plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## A two dimensional table

```{r}
table_age_likelihood <- 
  table(gp_covid$age_cat, gp_covid$hzcy001a)

table_age_likelihood
```

If the passed table object is two-dimensional, a conditional bar plot is created.

---

## Conditional barplot: stacked
The bar plot for a two-dimensional table object can either be stacked (default)...

.pull-left[
```{r bar_stacked, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table_age_likelihood)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_stacked", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Conditional barplot: side by side
... or it can be plotted side by side.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_side, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age_likelihood, 
  beside = TRUE
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_side", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## More plot types you can choose from
.pull-left[
Boxplots
- `boxplot(y ~ x)`

Pie charts (still possible in 2020)
- `pie(x)`

Scatterplot matrices
- `pairs(x)`

Mosaic Plots
- `mosaicplot(table)`

Densities
- `plot(density(x))`
]

.pull-right[
If you really want to see all plotting options in standard `R`, you could skim through the `graphics::` namespace:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/all_plotspng.png")
```
]


---

## One last detail: the `par()` and `dev.off()` function
`par()` stands for graphical parameters and is called before the actual plotting function. It prepares the graphics device in `R` and tells it: "Hey, plot(s) incoming!" A lot can be done within this function. The most commonly used options are for "telling" the device that 2, 3, 4, or `x` plots have to be printed.

We have used the option `mfrow` before by telling it how many rows (the first value in the vector) and columns (the second value in the vector) we aim to plot. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
```

One caveat of using this function is that we actively have to turn off the device before generating another independent plot.

```{r eval = FALSE}
dev.off()
```

This afternoon, we will learn about the `patchwork` package which makes assembling plots much easier.

## [Solutions](https://jobreu.github.io/r-intro-gesis-2020/solutions/Day3_1_Data_Visualization_1_Exercise_1_solution.html)

---

## Integrating plots in functions/packages
Creating plots in `R` is not complicated. Since the key advantage of `R` is the wealth of functionalities provide by additional packages, this accessible interface to plotting techniques is a real benefit.

This is why `plot()` often is a generic function not only to plot data directly. Some statistical models have their own plotting method called when you use the `plot()` command.

---

## Example: OLS model
.pull-left[
```{r lm_summary_plot, eval = FALSE}
linear_model <- 
  lm(
    hzcy001a ~ age_cat, 
    data = gp_covid
  )

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(linear_model)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "lm_summary_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Added-value plotting methods in other packages
Importantly, package developers provide new `R` functions that, in the background, make use of `R`'s plotting techniques. These packages save you from writing lengthy `R`-scripts just to get a specific layout of a plot.

---

## A correlation plot
.pull-left[
```{r corr_plot, eval = FALSE}
gp_covid %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    age_cat, 
    hzcy001a, 
    political_orientation, 
    education_cat
  ) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete.obs", method = "spearman") %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(method = "color")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "corr_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Fancy panels
.pull-left[
```{r panels_plot, eval = FALSE}
gp_covid %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    age_cat, 
    hzcy001a, 
    political_orientation, 
    education_cat
  ) %>% 
  psych::pairs.panels()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "panels_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## But sometimes that's not enough
In a way, ready-made functions for beautiful plots require you to, again,learn new commands, options, etc. And sometimes, you may have requirements that cannot even be fulfilled with these functions anyway.

These functions help combine information from different variables in a dataset. However, sometimes you may also want to re-create the same old boring graph repeatedly, e.g., for plotting results from similar but different statistical models.

For this purpose you can make use of your looping skills.

---

## Let's create some analysis results

```{r}
dependent_variables <-
  c("hzcy001a", "hzcy002a", "hzcy003a", "hzcy004a", "hzcy005a")

linear_models <-
  lapply(dependent_variables, function (dv) {
    lm(gp_covid[[dv]] ~ age_cat, data = gp_covid)
  }) %>% 
  magrittr::set_names(dependent_variables)
```

---

## The plot that we want to re-create multiple times
.pull-left[
```{r base_predictions_plot, eval = FALSE}
library(margins)
invisible(
  capture.output(
    cplot(
      linear_models[["hzcy001a"]], 
      main = "hzcy001a"
    )
  )
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "base_predictions_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Wrap your plot in a function
```{r}
fancy_pants_margins_plot <- function (my_models) {
  
  # define layout
  par(mfrow = c(ceiling(length(my_models)/2), 2))
  
  # plot all models
  for (model in names(my_models)) {
    invisible(
      capture.output(
        cplot(
          my_models[[model]],
          main = model
          
          # you can add plot parameter(s) to your liking
          # ...
          
        )
      )
    )
  }
}
```

---

## Run our function
.pull-left[
```{r fancy_pants_margins_plotted, eval = FALSE}
fancy_pants_margins_plot(linear_models)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "fancy_pants_margins_plotted", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Outlook on the next session
In the next session, we will work with plotting techniques using `ggplot2`. We will learn an alternative and more comfortable way of plotting data or results from different groups, e.g., by making use of so-called facets.  However, the trade-off is that the input data for the plots require more attention and simply more preparation.

---

## Exporting graphics
It's nice that `R` provides such pleasant plotting opportunities.

However, to include them in our papers, we need to export them.

As said in the beginning, numerous export formats are available in `R`.

---

## Export with *RStudio*

```{r echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("./pics/saveGraphic.PNG")
```

---

## Saving graphics via a command
Alternatively, you can also export plots with the commands `png()`, `pdf()` or `jpeg()`, for example. For this purpose, you first have to wrap the plot call between one of those functions and a `dev.off()`call.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
png("Histogram.png")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdf("Histogram.pdf")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jpeg("Histogram.jpeg")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

It's that easy.

---

## My personal note on R base plotting
Hopefully, you have gotten the feeling that the `base R` base techniques for plotting already are well-suited for your daily data exploration needs. Full disclosure: On some days, `hist()` is my most often used command.

But to be honest: I do not use all the other functions that often, particularly those from all the added-value packages for base plotting. The syntax is sometimes cumbersome with all the `par()`  or `dev.off()` calls, and manipulating parameters simply feels somewhat "outdated".

In the next session, we will learn more modern techniques using `ggplot2`. Yet, we still believe that it is worthwhile to become comfortable with `base R` plotting since `ggplot2`, e.g., may sometimes be "too much" for simple data exploration.

**As so often, in the end, it's also a matter of taste.**

# Extracurricular activities
Alright, so you may have gotten the feeling that standard `R` graphics are somewhat antiquated. But this need not be true. Have a look at [this excellent and also short blog post](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/styling-base-r-graphics/) about styling `base R` graphics. The post shows that, even with standard `R`, you can create great and publication-ready graphics.
